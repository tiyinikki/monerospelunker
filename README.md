### Do I have to build from source? 
No, you can download a compiled .exe by clicking on the release tab or going to tynkk.com. 

## How To Use
1. Open the program and enter how many threads you want to use (usually 1-6; Take the size of your CPU's cache in MB and divide that number in half to get a general idea of how many threads you can run);
2. Enter the mining mining pool (and port) you'd like to mine on
3, Enter your TiYinIkki wallet address, and then you just have to click start mining. 
* The Miner *Should* stop if you click stop mining or close the window, however, it's possible that you will need to kill the "minerd.exe" process (Hit Ctrl-Alt-Del and bring up the task manager) if the miner crashes for some reason. 

# Forked from jwinterm/MoneroSpelunker
This is a GUI wrapper made with VB .net for a cryptonight cpuminer. Rather than enter arguments on the command line, or create a batch file, the user can just open the program and fill the fields.
